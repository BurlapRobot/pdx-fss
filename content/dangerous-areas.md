  # Dangerous Areas


  Some areas of Portland are more dangerous than others. Districts 1 and 2 see significantly more fatal crashes than Districts 3 and 4. PBOT has designated a *High Crash Corridor* which consists of the 30 deadliest streets and intersections that see the most serious crashes. According to the Portland Bureau of Transportation, this fatal network makes up only 8% of the cityâ€™s streets yet accounted for 67% of traffic deaths from 2020 to 2024.
