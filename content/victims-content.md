title: "Portland Victims' Memorial – Human Lives are More Than Statistics. "
intro: The FSS PDX online memorial project honors and remembers lives lost to
  vehicular crashes and those who have suffered life-changing injuries on the
  streets of Portland, OR. This is not a comprehensive list of victims. Some
  victims are listed more than once because we received tributes from multiple
  loved ones. We update it as we receive information from families.  [Contact
