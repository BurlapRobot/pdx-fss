  # About Portland Families for Safe Streets


  Portland Families for Safe Streets is a small but growing road safety organization. Whether you have been directly impacted by road violence or an ally to the road safety movement, you are welcome to join our community of road-safety advocates.


  The Portland chapter was founded in 2015. When Kristi Finney-Dunn, whose son Dustin was killed by a drunk driver in 2010, learned about the New York chapter of Families for Safe Streets, she decided to reach out to local safe streets advocates. With support from the Bicycle Transportation Alliance, Oregon Walks and PBOT, Finney-Dunn connected with Susan Kubota, David Sale, and Kim Stone to found a chapter in Portland. Families for Safe Streets is now a national organization with chapters all across the country.


  ## Mission


  Portland Families for Safe Streets advocates for life-saving changes throughout our transportation system that will prevent crashes.


  ## Who we are


  Families for Safes Streets PDX is comprised of people who have lost loved ones or have been directly impacted by road traffic violence. We advocate for safe streets in a variety of ways, including working with local and state leaders, supporting life-saving legislation, critiquing roadway design, and more. All safe-streets allies are welcome to join FSS.


  ## Leadership


  * **Michelle DuBarry, Board Chair:** In 2010, Michelle's husband Eric and their one-year-old son Seamus were struck by a careless driver in a crosswalk. Eric survived, but Seamus died the following day. In 2019, she initiated and passed a Made Whole Statute in Oregon, which protects victims and survivors of car crashes from predatory insurance practices. She has published numerous essays about grief and loss, as well as op-eds advocating for policy and infrastructure changes to prevent other children and families from suffering similarly. More information about Made Whole legislation and links to her published work can be found on [her website](https://www.mdubarry.com/writing).

  * Secretary – Ted Beuhler

  * **Sarah Risser, Treasurer:** In January of 2019, Sarah and her son Henry set off from St. Paul, MN for the upper peninsula of Michigan to ski for a few days. Near Spooner, Wisconsin a negligent driver crossed the centerline and struck their vehicle head on. Henry, who was behind the wheel took the brunt of the impact and died at the scene. Sarah was injured in the crash but survived. Sarah moved from Saint Paul to Portland in 2022.
