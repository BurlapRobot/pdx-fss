  # About Portland Families for Safe Streets


  Portland Families for Safe Streets is a small but growing road safety organization. Whether you have been directly impacted by road violence or an ally to the road safety movement, you are welcome to join our community of road-safety advocates. 


  ## Mission


  Portland Families for Safe Streets advocates for life-saving changes throughout our transportation system that will prevent crashes.


  ## Who we are


  Families for Safes Streets PDX is comprised of people who have lost loved ones or have been directly impacted by road traffic violence. We advocate for safe streets in a variety of ways, including working with local and state leaders, supporting life-saving legislation, critiquing roadway design, and more. All safe-streets allies are welcome to join FSS.


  ## Leadership


  * **Michelle DuBarry, Board Chair:** In 2010, Michelle's husband Eric and their one-year-old son Seamus were struck by a careless driver in a crosswalk. Eric survived, but Seamus died the following day. In 2019, she initiated and passed a Made Whole Statute in Oregon, which protects victims and survivors of car crashes from predatory insurance practices. She has published numerous essays about grief and loss, as well as op-eds advocating for policy and infrastructure changes to prevent other children and families from suffering similarly. More information about Made Whole legislation and links to her published work can be found on [her website](https://www.mdubarry.com/writing).

  * Secretary – Ted Beuhler

  * Treasurer – Sarah Risser


  The current Board of Families for Safe Streets PDX wishes to acknowledge the vision and leadership of founding members Kristi Finney-Dunn, Kim Stone, Darla Sturdy, and David Sale.
