  # Partnerships


  FSS PDX proudly partners with local transportation nonprofits to advance road safety throughout Portland.




  ## Move Oregon Forward Coalition


  [Move Oregon Forward Coalition](https://www.moveoregonforward.org/) (MOF) works to ensure transportation is healthy, affordable, and safe and provides all Oregonians with the freedom to choose how they get to work, school, or anywhere else they are going on time and without risking their safety. MOF understands that relatively small investments now will pay off in significant ways in the future. MOF works to ensure our transportation needs are met, specifically: fair funding; accountability; and more robust investments in safety, transit, and pollution reduction.




  ## No More Freeways


  Families for Safe Streets is a co-plaintiff - along with Neighbors for Clean Air, BikeLoud PDX, and Elliot Neighborhood Association, led by [No More Freeways](https://nomorefreewayspdx.com/) -suing the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) over the I5 Rose Quarter Expansion. ODOT's expansion will create more traffic and emissions and is in direct opposition to Oregon's carbon reduction goals. The lawsuit alleges that the U.S. Department of Transportation violated their own rules by failing to conduct a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The lawsuit asks the court to find that ODOT and its federal partners violated NEPA and must conduct a full EIS.


  The lawsuit also alleges that ODOT's proposal is not compatible with Portland's Comprehensive Plan. Oregon's freeways have significant impacts on the city of Portland and come at an astronomical cost. If the plaintiffs prevail, ODOT will have to work with the city of Portland to ensure their project matches the comprehensive plan, or Portland will need to amend its comprehensive plan to include an accurate description of the highway expansion project.
