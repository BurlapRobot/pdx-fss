  # Test


  This is a test page, you can use it to test out editing pages and seeing how your changes look once published. It uses markdown as syntax and can run HTML too. You can have as much content here as you want, so feel free to leave samples here for reference, or remove them if they won't be needed again.


  ## Image Layout Demo


  <!-- this is an HTML comment, it won't be displayed to users but can be used to comment on the code to people looking at it in the future -->



  <img src="/images/uploads/headshot-final-web.jpg" alt="Description" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; width: 20%;">

  Text that wraps around the image on the right.


  Note the image specifies a custom width to make it smaller than the original photo resolution.


  <!-- the next line specifies that following text should stop wrapping around the image --> 

  <p style="clear: both;"></p>


  <!-- the next line is a break, it adds just a bit of space on the page -->
