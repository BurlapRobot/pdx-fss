  # Why It Matters


  Well over 540 people have lost their lives in Portland road traffic in the past decade and countless more have suffered debilitating or life-altering injury. The scope of this loss of life is unimaginable in and of itself; however, a true accounting of the cost of road violence must also include the life-sentences of grief inflicted on the victim's family, friends, and community as well as the lost contributions the victim would have made in their life. 


  Crashes are preventable. These are not "accidents." The systemic issues that cause road fatalities have proven solutions. No death or life altering injury in a traffic crash is acceptable.
