  ## State-Level Legislation FSS PDX Supports


  ### Intelligent Speed Assistance


  *Intelligent Speed Assistance,* ISA, is an in-vehicle technology that helps drivers maintain safe speeds. This technology is available in either passive or active forms. Passive ISA alerts drivers when they exceed posted limits whereas active ISA prevents vehicles from exceeding a certain speed, based on the posted speed limit.



  There is a growing bipartisan movement and push to adopt Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) policies across the country, powered by the voices of victims and survivors of traffic violence. The movement began in New York State, where FSS members were instrumental in introducing the first ISA-related bill in the U.S. Efforts in New York laid the groundwork for other local campaigns, including in Washington, D.C., where in 2024 the local FSS chapter successfully advocated for passage of the first ISA law in the country. This historic win marked the beginning of a growing national trend. Washington and Virginia have passed laws mandating ISA for super speeders and similar efforts are underway in Arizona, Maryland, California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Tennesee, Georgia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. FSS PDX recognizes ISA as a commonsense, targeted tool to prevent the most dangerous forms of speeding, one that should be adopted in Oregon.
