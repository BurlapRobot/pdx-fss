  ### Vision Zero Task Force – A Renewed Commitment to Vision Zero


  On May 19, 2025, Portland City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee voted unanimously to approve a resolution introduced by Councilor Tiffany Koyama Lane to reaffirm the city’s commitment to Vision Zero. Among other things, the resolution calls for the formation of a new task force to expand responsibility for realizing Vision Zero goals beyond PBOT. The new Task Force will include multiple bureaus: Forestry, Housing, Portland Solutions, Policy, Fire, Police, and potentially more. The exact make-up of this new Task Force is forthcoming. FSS PDX hopes for a seat at the table and will be watching this closely.

  ### Intelligent Speed Assistance


  *Intelligent Speed Assistance,* or ISA, is a safety technology that helps drivers maintain safe speeds. This technology is available in various forms. Passive ISA alerts drivers when they exceed posted limits whereas “active” ISA prevents vehicles from exceeding a certain speed, based on the speed limit.

  There is now a growing movement and push to adopt Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) policies across the country, powered by the voices of victims and survivors of traffic violence. The movement began in New York State, where FSS members were instrumental in introducing the first ISA-related bill in the U.S. Their efforts laid the groundwork for other local campaigns, including in Washington, D.C., where the local FSS chapter successfully advocated for the passage of the first ISA law in the country in 2024. This historic win marked the beginning of a growing national trend. Washington, Georgia, and Virginia have passed laws mandating ISA for super speeders and similar efforts are underway in Arizona, Maryland, California. FSS PDX recognizes ISA as a commonsense, targeted tool to prevent the most dangerous forms of speeding, one that should be adopted in Oregon.
