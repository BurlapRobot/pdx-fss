## The Safe Systems Approach 

The **Safe System Approach** is a proven, holistic framework for preventing traffic deaths and serious injuries. It is built on the principle that human safety should be the highest priority in transportation planning and take precedence over the speed, throughput, and convenience of motor vehicles. This approach recognizes that people make mistakes and focuses on designing transportation networks that anticipate and mitigate those mistakes by creating multiple layers of protection so that when crashes occur, they are far less likely to kill or cause catastrophic harm.

Rather than placing the burden of safety solely on individual road users, the Safe System Approach emphasizes five key principles that work together to reduce danger and reinforce safety: 
1. Safe Roads - designing roadways intentionally to slow traffic with wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, safe intersection design and more, 
2. Safe Speeds – setting speed limits that are appropriate to the context and vulnerability of road users, 
3. Safe Vehicles – designing vehicles equipped with lifesaving technology, 
4. Safe Road Users – prioritizing the most vulnerable road users,which makes the road safer for all users, 
5. Support Victims – providing port-crash care to better support victims. 

By addressing these elements together, communities can create a forgiving road system that protects all road users.
