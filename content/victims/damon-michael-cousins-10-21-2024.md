"Damon was a much loved son, brother, cousin, uncle, and friend. He was a devoted fan of the New Orleans Saints and an excellent baker, his specialty being chocolate chip cookies. He was blessed with a great sense of humor, intelligence, and compassion. Using the same route to work he'd used for four years, he was struck and killed by a motorist on a rainy Monday morning. He was only 32 years old. His loss cuts deep but he will forever live on in the minds and hearts of all who knew him. Rest in peace my son." - Susie Wolf
