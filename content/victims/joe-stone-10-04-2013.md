Joe was a big hearted, witty person with a lot of spunk and character. He was stubborn at times but fiercely protective of his family and friends. He loved animals; especially his dogs, and loved spending time with his nephews, Holden and Sage. Joe was a sports fanatic and was an encyclopedia of sports knowledge and stats. He also enjoyed music, cooking, playing his X-Box and hanging out with his friends. He will be dearly missed by all who knew and loved him.
