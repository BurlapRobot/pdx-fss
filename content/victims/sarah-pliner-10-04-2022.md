Sarah moved to Portland from New York City in 1990 after graduating from high school. She attended Reed College, but dropped out and started working at restaurants. She found a spot in the esteemed kitchen of The Heathman Hotel, which was her first big opportunity in the world of fine dining. From there she traveled back to New York to gain experience working alongside notable chefs before returning to Portland a few years later. She opened Aviary in 2011 and it put Sarah on the map — although she never sought the limelight.

Aviary closed in 2020 during the pandemic. After which Sarah became chef at Fullerton Wines and also cooked at Bluto’s on SE Belmont. She was on her way to Bluto’s Tuesday when she was hit.
