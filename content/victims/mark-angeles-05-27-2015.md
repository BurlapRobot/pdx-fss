Mark Angeles was struck and killed by the driver of a tow truck just one week after graduating from Reed College. Mark graduated with a major in chemistry and had been recognized as one of Reed's "12 for 15" as a result of his many achievements. 

Mark's family shared the following statement with the Reed College community: *Mark was the best kind of person. He was passionate and driven, but at the same time incredibly loving. He made it his mission every single day to simply love people, in whatever way that looked like. He had eyes that could always see the good in other people, even when all they could see was bad. He was a true and unique light to this world, and he will be sorely missed. Thank you, Mark, for touching lives simply by being yourself.*
