Seamus was born on Christmas day, 2008. He quickly grew into a tank of a toddler, with huge feet, curly blonde hair, and a pot belly that peeked out from beneath his t-shirts. He loved animals, being outside, looking at the "big moon," and eating pizza. In November, 2010, Seamus and his dad Eric were walking home from the grocery store when they were struck by a careless driver in a crosswalk. Eric survived, but Seamus died the following day. We remember him when we look at the moon, and any time we see a "buddy buddy" (his word for butterfly).
