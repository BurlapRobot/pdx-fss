Joes was 36 and married with a 2.5 year old daughter.

A lifelong artist, Joey began acting at the age of three and evolved into a gifted filmmaker with a powerful creative voice. Together with his wife and daughter, he deepened his love for cinema - transforming it into a shared family journey. Through [TheoFilms.com](https://theofilms.com), their independent narratives and documentaries reached international audiences and were recognized at prestigious film festivals.

To his wife, **Joey's emotional intelligence and sensitivity were unmatched** - a presence of rare depth and clarity. She knew from the day they met that this was the beginning of a shared journey in family and creative life. His brilliant mind and heart translated complex truths into stories that were both deeply human and profoundly moving.

Joey was not only an artist - he was a devoted father, husband, and collaborator whose warmth, responsibility, and brilliance shaped every part of their shared world. He leaves a **void impossible to fill.**

Their daughter, **Matilda**, was meant to be the first of three children.
