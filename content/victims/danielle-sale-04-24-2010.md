Danielle had wisdom, insight and grace far beyond her chronological age, along with the uncanny ability to act silly and make other people laugh. She enjoyed a close bond with her large extended family, loved to travel, and was studying to become a nurse. In April, 2010, a Tri-Met bus driver made an illegal left turn through a crosswalk, striking Danielle and four of her friends as they crossed. She is forever loved and missed by her family, friends, and all who had the pleasure of knowing her.
